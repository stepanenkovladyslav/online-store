# online-store


Anime merchendise online store. Contains both server and client. Most of the work was completed in client, even though some server work was also done by me.
Contains admin panel where anyone can create and add categories, products, brands and users. To access admin panel go to "url/adminlogin", and use

username: admin@gmail.com, password: admin

If you return to the website, and want to come back to the admin panel, go to "url/admin" if you are already logged in. 

To access user cabinet, create an account and login with it.

If you want to look at the mobile version of the webiste, load the page in the mobile mode. Mobile menu is a separate component which renders when the page
is loaded in mobile screen size.
